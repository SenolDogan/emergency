EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ML ANALYSIS RESULTS
========================================

Data Overview:
- Total samples: 210,635 patients
- After filtering: 205,828 patients (removed triage value 6)
- Features used: 20 (age, sex, visit_month, vital signs, department visits)
- Triage classes: 5 (0-4, corresponding to original 1-5)
- Department classes: 13 unique departments

TRIAGE PREDICTION MODEL:
------------------------
Accuracy: 60.98%
AUC: 0.728
Macro Average F1-Score: 0.31
Weighted Average F1-Score: 0.57

Class-wise Performance:
- Class 0 (Original 1): Precision=0.70, Recall=0.79, F1=0.74 (21,416 samples)
- Class 1 (Original 2): Precision=0.38, Recall=0.02, F1=0.03 (1,213 samples)
- Class 2 (Original 3): Precision=0.64, Recall=0.13, F1=0.22 (4,330 samples)
- Class 3 (Original 4): Precision=0.48, Recall=0.64, F1=0.55 (11,877 samples)
- Class 4 (Original 5): Precision=0.50, Recall=0.01, F1=0.01 (2,330 samples)

DEPARTMENT PREDICTION MODEL:
----------------------------
Accuracy: 100.0%
Perfect classification achieved - likely due to deterministic department assignment based on visit patterns.

2. department_confusion_matrix.png - Confusion matrix for department prediction  
3. triage_feature_importance.png - Top 10 most important features for triage prediction
4. triage_risk_score_distribution.png - Distribution of risk scores for triage group 1

KEY INSIGHTS:
-------------
1. The triage model shows moderate performance (61% accuracy) with good performance on the most common class (Class 0)
2. Department prediction achieves perfect accuracy, suggesting strong patterns in department assignment
3. The model struggles with rare triage classes (1, 2, 4) due to class imbalance
4. Feature importance analysis reveals which patient characteristics most influence triage decisions

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
1. Consider class balancing techniques (SMOTE, undersampling) for better performance on rare triage classes
2. The department prediction model may be overfitting - consider feature selection or regularization
3. Focus on improving recall for critical triage classes (1 and 4) which have low recall scores
4. Use the feature importance plot to guide clinical decision support system development
